# Image-segmentation-using-superpixels-and-k-means-clustering

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple different regions (or segments). 
The goal is to change the representation of the image into an easier and more meaningful image.

It is an important step in image processing, as real world images doesn't always contain only one object that we wanna classify.
For instance, for self driving cars, the image would contain the road, cars, pedestrians, etc. So we may need to use segmentation here to separate objects and 
analyze each object individually (i.e image classification) to check what it is.

Here, I have used OpenCV for this purpose.
Image segmentation can be done using various techniques. The techniques which I have used are superpixels and k means clustering.
